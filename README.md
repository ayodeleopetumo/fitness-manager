## Setup and install

Fork this repo from inside GitHub so you can commit directly to your account, or simply download the .zip bundle with the contents inside.

### Project installation and server

Now you've pulled down, using your terminal you'll need to change directory (`cd`) into the directory that you cloned the repo into and run some quick tasks:

```
cd <app directory>
